VERSION 1.1.1:
- Removed the placeholder code related to the Labubu enemy. Now, the Labubu enemy functions identically to the Gnome enemy, and will be compatible with future R.E.P.O. updates.
- Adjusted Labubu animations to look more realistic.

VERSION 1.1.0:
- Added a new enemy: the Labubu! The Labubu is a replacement for the Gnome enemy, and its addition features a new prefab, new animations, and some new audio. The Labubu model I used was created by Alex CGW on FAB.
- Fixed and optimized lots of code I wrote when I was half-asleep.

VERSION 1.0.1:
- Fixed a bug where the Peeper was still allowed to appear, and added a touch of rainbow.

VERSION 1.0.0:
- Added a new enemy: Ceiling Dev! Ceiling Dev is a replacement for the Peeper enemy, and its addition features a new prefab, some new audio, and (most importantly) my friend, Dev!
